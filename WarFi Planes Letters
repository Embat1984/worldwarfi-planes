Ideas about WarFi Planes

1. Building a hangar page where every user can see its valuable and unique planes. Three sections will be available:

a) Main Plane Section - Where player can enjoy the view of its magnificent aircraft, read some basic information about the machine and also
see the quantitiy of the NFT tokens. Menu is included with the following options:

I) Plane market - With simple words the place where you can sell or buy the same model of the plane. Using the rule of LP or auction option or open offers to respond.
II) Select Mission - The owner of the token must benefit from it. So if player has the appropriate plane he can participate in special Liquidity Pool where he can earn
Medals and special rewards. The token is locked in the pool until the mission is finished and after that can Harvest and Withdraw the medal or the reward. Rewards can
be fungible tokens with fixed supply so after the mission 10% of Medal or Reward token goes to WWT holders - Praise the House!

P.S - Because every unique plane is NFT token it will be easy pool to use only one single asset. For two pairs (must think about logic later).

This is only a note and has no real value. It is some basic thoughts and nothing more. Hope to update it soon. Thank you if you read that!
